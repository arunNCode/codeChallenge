How to execute the protractor test scripts?
Pre-requisites:
1. Nodes js should be installed in the system.
2. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. Install npm using npm install –g npm


Steps:
Step 1: Install the below mentioned node modules in local workspace:
1. Install Protractor by running 
   * npm install protractor –save –dev
1. Install webdriver-manager for selenium server and browser driver manager
   * npm install webdriver-manager --save-dev
1. Install Cucumber and protractor-cucumber-framework packages
   * npm install -cucumber –save-dev
   * npm install --save-dev protractor-cucumber-framework.
1. Install chai for assertions
   * npm install chai –save-dev 
1. Install grunt to create a task for CI 
   * npm install grunt–save-dev
Step 2: Take latest code from repository and put it on local workspace (e.g.  .\node_modules\test\).
Step 3: Start selenium standalone server running the command:
java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=<Absolute/relative path>\chromedriver_2.40.exe exe -jar =<Absolute/relative path>\\selenium-server-standalone-3.11.0.jar -port 4444
(If needed other browser driver location also can be updated here)
Step 4: From your local workspace call protractor with required config file to be executed, e.g. D:\Workspace> protractor node_modules\test\protractor-config.js.

P.S - If provided with more time:
- I would have used page object model framework by keeping the page specific interactions and functions in the respective page file. 
- Protractor image comparison library which compares the actual UI with an already captured screenshot which helps to identify the User Interface  issues, I would have added that also for UI checks.
